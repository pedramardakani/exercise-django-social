* Inspiration

This project is inspired from DevOpsHobbies' Django CI CD Nexus Registry [[https://github.com/devopshobbies/django-ci-cd-NexusRegistry][Github repository.]]

This is by no means not a detailed and in-depth tutorial.
Take this as a set of notes to self.

Thanks to the wonderful [[https://github.com/devopshobbies][DevOpsHobbies]] team for their inspiration.

* Notes

** Server hardening

1. Make it harder for inruders to hack into your SSH environment!
   
2. Create backups! At least three, and one outside the server environment.
   This is to minimize the harm taken if the server gets attacked.

*** Make the SSH connection more secure

**** Change the default port from 22

**** Go for passwordless authentication

#+BEGIN_SRC console
  $ target_username="user"    # REPLACE with your server username
  $ target_ip="192.168.43.10" # REPLACE with your server ip
  $ ssh-copy-id ${target_username}@${target_ip}
  /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
  /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
  user@192.168.43.10's password: 

  Number of key(s) added: 1

  Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'user@192.168.43.10'"
  and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
